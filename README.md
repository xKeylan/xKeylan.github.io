**TeeShirt Co. is developing an innovative online platform where you can customize and purchase T-shirts. Our project logo features a unique blend of the letter T and an S, perfectly symbolizing our brand.**


**## Project Name and Description**

TeeShirt Co. is more than just a shopping destination; it's designed to offer a seamless experience for T-shirt enthusiasts. From browsing a variety of styles to making secure purchases, we've crafted a platform that allows customers to express their individuality through personalized apparel. Our objective is to provide a user-friendly interface with simplified navigation and a straightforward checkout process.


**## Project Features and Limitations**

This project focuses specifically on T-shirts, which means we won't be expanding into other apparel types—at least not yet. While customers will enjoy a great level of customization, it will be limited to what’s offered on our website. Initially, our shipping will target domestic orders only.


**## Inventory and Control**

We have a well-structured inventory consisting of various T-shirts, sorted by style, color, and size. Our plan includes effective inventory management to prevent overselling while keeping customers satisfied. 

As we can see here

**For example**, one of our sample items is the Basic Cotton T-Shirt:  
**Item Name:** Basic Cotton T-Shirt  
**Description:** A comfortable cotton T-shirt available in various colors.  
**Retail Price:** $19.99  
**Quantity:** 50  
**Restock Threshold:** 10  



**## Development Plan**

Our timetable sets clear milestones for the project development with detailed deadlines leading up to our final submission. Here's a quick look:  
- By March 11, 2025, we aim to complete the project proposal.  
- By April 8, 2025, we’ll polish everything for final submission.
