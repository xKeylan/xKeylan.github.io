## DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM  
**Current Issues:**  
Company S is facing challenges in managing inventory across multiple user roles, leading to inefficiencies and customer dissatisfaction. The current high cart abandonment rate—around 70%—is a critical concern, driven by barriers in the checkout process. Without a custom solution, Company S risks losing significant revenue.

**Specific Issues Impacting Business:**
1. Lack of inventory control with real-time stock tracking leads to overselling.
2. Inefficient user experience deters customers at checkout.
3. Insufficient management tools for oversight and analysis of sales data.

**Goal:**  
Our proposal addresses these challenges by designing a dynamic e-commerce platform. This application will streamline operations, enhance customer experience, and significantly improve inventory management.

## OBJECTIVES  
1. Develop a user-friendly e-commerce website that accommodates role-based access for Customers, Employees, and Managers.  
2. Integrate advanced inventory management with real-time stock monitoring across multiple product categories.  
3. Equip Managers with comprehensive reporting tools and the ability to manage customer data and promotional codes effectively.
