TeeShirt Co. is an innovative online platform for customizing and purchasing T-shirts. Customers can browse a variety of styles, designs, and personalized options to express their creativity.

## Detailed Description
TeeShirt Co. is designed to deliver a seamless online shopping experience for T-shirt enthusiasts. The platform enables customers to select their preferred T-shirt style, personalize it with custom text or images, and make secure purchases. By offering a unique blend of quality and customization, we aim to provide personalized apparel that resonates with individuals looking to express their unique styles. The website will also feature high-quality images of the T-shirts available, simplified navigation, and a straightforward checkout process.

## Scope
